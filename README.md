### ***Description*** 

#### A Jeopardy inspired game that showcases Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Similar to the show, the game has 5 "catagories" and 5 corresponding columns where each question has a different value which is added together to get a total score. This game utilizes Event Listeners to handle user input('click') and relies heavily on Functions and looping within said functions.
